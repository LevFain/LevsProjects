This program:
	-Selects a random scenario from the scnx sub folder in files.
	-Overwrites the scenario.bat with the new randomly selected scenario.
	-Makes sure that the selected scenario is present in the %MAK_VRFDIR%/userData/scenarios folder.
	-Starts the scenario.bat.
	-Allows you to change the used domain in the BAT file without the need to open the bat and edit it yourself

Important -
	Make sure that your %MAK_VRFDIR%, is pathed to the currently used VRF and to the most updated one.

How to use:
	1) Place any scenario file you want in the scnx folder
	2) start "start.bat"
	3) type either 'start' or 'change'
		-start; starts the main program
		-change; allows you to change the domainID in the BAT that will be used
	
	
Comes with a few random scenarios I chose for testings....
